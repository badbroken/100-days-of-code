# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned and revised Python Syntax, User input and Functions.

**Thoughts**: Just revising and practicing the stuffs that I already knew. It's always better to have a fresh start. 

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 1 is to learn about Python (Control Flow), PHP (syntax, strings, variables and Numbers).



### Day 1: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: learned about Python control flow statements (if-else, try-except, boolean, relational operators), PHP strings, numbers and variables.

**Thoughts**: Learned quite a lot of things in Day0 and Day1. Maybe it's time to take a break from learning further for a bit and focus on problem solving so that I can put my knowledge in practical use.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 2 is to learn about PHP functions, built-in functions & solve some problems online using what I learnt in Python.

**Resources**: I am learning PHP and Python from Codecademy.



### Day 2: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: used python control flow knowledge to implement a small project. Learned about php functions and implemented the knowledge by making a small project as well.

**Thoughts**: I was supposed to cover php built-in functions as well. But I failed to do so. It's natural to set bigger goals after completing goals in a row, but we have to keep in mind that our mind's capacity for new knowledge and the ability to deliver properly. Pressurizing ourselves will only hurt us in the end by not being able to complete the target. Lesson from today: Target what you can, not what you want.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 3 is to learn about PHP built-in functions & solve online problems using python.

### Day 3: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about PHP built in functions and created a small project using php built in functions, utilizing what I have learned.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 4 is to take a break from php dedicate whole day to online problem solve using Python, aiming to solve at least 20 problems.

### Day 4: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved programming problems using python in urionlinejudge website.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 5 is to learn about Python Lists.


### Day 5: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Python List, List operations. Made some small projects demonstrating what I learned.

**Thoughts** : While learning about lists. I asked myself: What's the difference between arrays and lists? because they look way too similar. After doing my research, I realized they're like twins, but their characteristics are quite different. This might be a possible interview question in near future? Who knows? Doing extensive research now may seem exhausting, but this will pay out later on someday. Trust me.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 6 is to learn about Python Tuples, PHP arrays.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
