# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned and revised Python Syntax, User input and Functions.

**Thoughts**: Just revising and practicing the stuffs that I already knew. It's always better to have a fresh start. 

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 1 is to learn about Python (Control Flow), PHP (syntax, strings, variables and Numbers).



### Day 1: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: learned about Python control flow statements (if-else, try-except, boolean, relational operators), PHP strings, numbers and variables.

**Thoughts**: Learned quite a lot of things in Day0 and Day1. Maybe it's time to take a break from learning further for a bit and focus on problem solving so that I can put my knowledge in practical use.

**What's Next**: The plan for Day 2 is to learn about PHP functions, built-in functions & solve some problems online using what I learnt in Python.

**Resources**: I am learning PHP and Python from Codecademy.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
